            <h3>1.1 background</h3>
            <p>The founder believes that all human civilizations originate from rivers, such as the Tigris River, the Nile River and the Yellow River, which gave birth to the three oldest civilizations in the world. In Spanish, "San" means sacred, and "Rio" means river. The founder takes the name of the sacred river to express respect for human civilization. And then developed Sanrio, a company with social communication as its corporate purpose.</p>
            <h3>1.2 brief introduction</h3>
